# Canvas Playground

A simple infrastructure for playing with the Canvas API in CoffeeScript.

## Installation

You'll need to have npm and node installed to easily build coffee-script and stitch.

```
git clone https://github.com/massivelyfun/canvas-playground.git

cd canvas-playground

npm install
```
## Use

* Extend from entity.coffee and rect.coffee for your game entities and
drawing primitives (or, duck type--the APIs are super simple).

* Instantiate your entities in main.coffee

* Do something interesting with their update() methods (this gets
  called for every entity, once per tick and is where you should
  update position, etc.)

* Add your entity to the game loop via GameLoop#addEntity

* Run the loop!

## Build and view your handywork

```
cake build
# on a mac
open public/index.html
```

Or use the handy-dandy, built-in dev server:

```
coffee server.coffee
```

...then navigate to http://localhost:4000. Changes you make should
show up as soon as you save a file.
